.TH BWGET 1 "22 May 2025" "bwget 0.4.0" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
bwget \- “Better Wget” in Python
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bwget
URL [\fIoptions\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBbwget\fR is a tiny, single-file Python replacement for the most-used parts
of GNU wget.  
It supports HTTP/HTTPS downloads with a nice progress bar, .torrent and magnet
link handling (single torrent at a time, no seeding), automatic filename
selection, automatic \fIresume\fR (now the default), TLS verification,
automatic retries with exponential back-off, optional SHA-256 verification,
proxy support, optional HTTP authentication, and user configuration via a TOML file.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-o, \-\-output \fIFILE\fR
Write the downloaded data to \fIFILE\fR instead of the remote filename.
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-continue
\fIDisable\fR resuming.  
By default bwget will resume an interrupted download if a matching partial
file is present and the server supports HTTP range requests.  Supplying
\fB\-c\fR forces a fresh download from byte 0, overwriting any existing file.
.TP
.B \-q, \-\-quiet
Suppress non-error output (hides the progress bar).
.TP
.B \-\-sha256 \fIDIGEST\fR
Expected SHA-256 checksum (64 hex digits).  
If omitted, bwget attempts to fetch \fI<URL>.sha256\fR automatically.
.TP
.B \-\-proxy \fIPROXY_URL\fR
Use the specified HTTP/HTTPS proxy
(e.g.\  \fIhttp://user:pass@host:port\fR).
Overrides any proxy defined in the config file or environment.
.TP
.B \-\-auth \fICRED\fR
HTTP Basic credentials (\fIuser:pass\fR) or a Bearer token. If
\fICRED\fR contains a colon, it is treated as a username and password;
otherwise it is used as a Bearer token.
.TP
.B \-\-version
Display version information and exit.

.SH CONFIGURATION
bwget looks for a TOML config file at  
\fI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bwget/config.toml\fR  
(default \fI~/.config/bwget/config.toml\fR).  
A sample file is created on first run.

.TP
Force a fresh download even if a partial file exists:
.B bwget \-c https://example.com/large.iso
.TP
Verify SHA-256 while downloading:
.B bwget \-\-sha256 0123456789abcdef... https://example.com/app.tar.gz
.TP
Download through a proxy:
.B bwget \-\-proxy http://proxy.local:3128 https://example.com/data.zip
.TP
Authenticate with Basic credentials:
.B bwget \-\-auth user:pass https://example.com/secure/file
